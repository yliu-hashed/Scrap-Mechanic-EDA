# The NOOB Guide

This guide provides a few resources for those who need help knowing where to begin.

## Unix File System Commands

Unix commands allow you to navigate the file system using the terminal alone.

[A Geeks for Geeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-commands/) is available on this topic. Mastering the *File and Directory Manipulation* section is enough.

## Verilog

Verilog is a Hardware Descriptive Language (HDL) that Yosys fully supports. It has quite a steep learning curve. It may be easier if you already know how to program. But remember that HDL describes hardware structure, not software flow.

[The Verilog tutorial from Chipverify](https://www.chipverify.com/verilog/verilog-tutorial) is an exhaustive tutorial containing everything you need to get started.

[A FPGA guide by BrunoLevy on Github](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga) contains project-based tutorials. It will even show you how to build a RISC-V processor.

## GNU Make

GNU Make is just a build-step sequencer. We use it for its convenience. If you hate it, you can easily accomplish the same thing with a basic shell script.

GNU Make and Makefile can be learned from [GNU's tutorial](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html). Mastering the basic features should be enough. With the [example Makefile from Example-2](/Resources/Example-2/Makefile), you should be able to create Make projects on your own.

## Docker

Docker is a container runner. It is essentially a slim Virtual Machine platform that's fast and performant. It requires significant expertise to use effectively. [Docker's own docs](https://docs.docker.com/) provide exhaustive information for all command line arguments and features. Thankfully, you don't need to understand everything. You only need to run an image, not to create one.
